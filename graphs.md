## Graphs

Graphs are just a data structure. Here are some of their methods:

    UnweightedGraph {
      nodes
      edges
      addNode
      removeNode
      addEdge
      removeEdge
      edgeWeightFromNode
      edgesAtNode
      distanceBetweenEdges
    }

Lists are just a particular kind of graph.
