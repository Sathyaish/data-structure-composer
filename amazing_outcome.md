# Amazing outcome

If this project went really well, what would it be able to do?

- min stack
- min queue
- Time-travelling key value store
- List with getIndexOfMax
- List with getMax
- Design a data structure that supports the following operations: insert_back(), remove_front() and find_mode(), all in O(1)
- Is there a data structure for key-value pairs that allows insert, update, deletion and finding the minimal value all in log(n)?

## Maximally ambitious version

is of course to output actual code.
