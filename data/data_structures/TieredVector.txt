ds TieredVector extends ArrayList {
    getByIndex <- 1
    updateNode! <- 1

    insertAtIndex! <- sqrt(n)
    insertLast! <- 1

    // in the original paper, it doesn't make insertFirst! fast. But you can always just
    // do the banker's queue trick
    insertFirst! <- 1

    deleteAtIndex! <- sqrt(n)

    // you can delete at the ends easily
    deleteLast! <- 1
    deleteFirst! <- 1
}

A tiered vector is a fun data structure made from an array of arrays.
[Here's the original paper about it.](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/pubs/wads99.pdf)
The basic idea is that when you have n items,
you have a single layer of indirection to sqrt(n) arrays of size approximately sqrt(n). Inserting
or deleting from those takes O(sqrt(n)) amortized.
