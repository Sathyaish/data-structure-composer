ds SparseTableForIdempotentReduction[reduction] if reduction.idempotent {
    twoSidedIndexRangeQuery[reduction] <- 1 + reduction
    insertLast! <- log(n)
    deleteLast! <- 1
}

This is a data structure for quickly answering queries of the form "what's the minimum of the elements between indexes `i` and `j`". It works for other reductions
than minimum, but they have to be idempotent.
