Suppose you want to maintain the minimum of a stack. You can do this by maintaining two
 stacks, as described eg [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/685074/1360429).

Here's an animated GIF:

(Incidentally, you can build this data structure for a stack
[with only O(1) space](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-that-supports-getmin-in-o1-time-and-o1-extra-space/).)
